# brief about oops concept .
#   oops is a methadology to design a program using classes and objects. it simplifies the software development and maintainence
# the following are oops concepts
#1. obect and class
#2. encapsulation
#3. abstaction 
#4. inheritence
#5 . polymorphism
#6 .dynamic binding
#7.message passing
#Object:object is anything which has a physical existence.every object contains properties and perform actions.
properties : name , height ,weight ,age  =>variables
actions    :eating , reading =>functions

# Class :- set of well defined objects belong to same group is called class.
# a class is way to combine variables of functions into a single unit
# a single class may contain any no of objects

# Encapsulation :- wrapping variable,functions into a single unit is called encapsulation.
# encapsulations is implemented by using classes concept . 
# this puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental change,an objects
# method.those type of variables are known as private variables
 
## Abstaction:- hiding unnecessary data from the user is called obstaction 
# this means that without knowing background details of data we can get output by performing actions
# abstraction can be implemented by using the keywords 
1.public 2. private 3. protected 4 . default called as access specifiers
# abstaction is also implemented by using abstact calsses concept

# Inheritence :- acquiring properties from one entity to another entity is called inheritence
# inheritence is a way to create a new class from already existing class
# exsisting class is called super class or parent class
# newly created class is called child class or subclass or derived class
# in inheritence subcalss has its own properties as well as its super calss properties
# the main advantage of inheritence is logic code reusability

#Types of inheritence
1. single inheritence
2. multilevel inheritence
3. multiple inheritence
4. hirarchial inheritence
5. hybrid inheritence

# polymorphism : polymorphism means ability to exist in may forms

# Dynamic binding : the code associated with the function will not known until execution time of the program 
# is called dynamic binding

#message passing : sending message from one thread to another
